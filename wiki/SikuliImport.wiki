= Importing images from Sikuli projects =

The sikuliimport package provides a mechanism to import symbols, especially image constants, from Sikuli projects into python modules.

A module that wants to import symbols from a Sikuli project can do so by importing them from the sikuliimport.projects module:
{{{
from sikuliimport.projects import *
}}}
The sikuliimport.projects module imports symbols from one or more Sikuli projects that are listed in a configuration file. In addition, any string that appears to be a Sikuli image filename is replaced with its absolute filename. For example, given the following constant in a Sikuli project:
{{{
FOO_CONST = '1270078045794.png'
}}}
{{{FOO_CONST}}} will be imported into the current module as
{{{
FOO_CONST = r'C:\Documents and Settings\username\Sikuli\foo.sikuli\1270078045794.png'
}}}
The image filename expansion goes recursively through the basic python data structures (i.e. lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, frozensets).

= Configuration =

You specify which Sikuli projects are imported by listing them in sikuliimport/settings.py, which is imported by sikuliimport.projects. For example, to import symbols from two Sikuli projects, foo.sikuli and bar.sikuli, you put the following line in sikuliimport/settings.py:
{{{
SIKULI_PROJECT_DIRS = [r'C:\Documents and Settings\username\Sikuli\foo.sikuli',
                       r'C:\Documents and Settings\username\Sikuli\bar.sikuli']
}}}
If sikuliimport/settings.py does not exist, sikuliimport.projects tries to import sikuliimport/defaultsettings.py.
